# space-invaders-arm-stm32
A space-invaders arcade game written in ARM Assembly for STM32 microcontrollers with TFT display

# Space Invaders – ARM Assembly Game (STM32 Project)

This project is a low-level **Space Invaders-style arcade game** developed in **ARM Assembly Language** as the final project for the Microprocessor course.

The game was developed for and deployed on an **STM32 microcontroller** with a **TFT display**, using pure assembly code.
